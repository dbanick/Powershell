Basic Instructions:
Step 1: Verify you can connect to all instances from the main server

Step 2: Copy the CSV folder up to your laptop

step 3: ??????
Step 4: Profit

******Powershell_Discovery_Run_v1.ps1******

You can run without ISE

Update servers.txt with list of intances to connect to (no white spaces at end of file)

You may need to run Powershell as Administrator, and also set the Execution Policy via "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned". Refer to http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx

This will run the Initialize-SQLpsEnvironment.ps1 script to install some of the SQL modules which are required to execute the script.

This will run any scripts you place in SQL_Scripts

This will generate a seperate folder for each instance's output in a subfolder "CSV"

Failed servers should be logged to servers_redo.txt so you can easily rerun it (after renaming the servers.txt files)

Empty files will be deleted if the script fails

Empty folders will be deleted if all scripts fail


*****Powershell_Discovery_compile_v1.ps1******
Needs to run on a machine (laptop) with excel - does not need to interface with the server's at all

This script will compile all of the csv files for a single server into one spreadsheet.

Relies on ConvertCSV-ToExcel.ps1

This will process all CSV files located in each subfolder of CSV.

It will generate a spreadsheet of all the CSV files, then move it to Compiled_Spreadsheets.

If all CSV were properly processed for a folder, the folder will be moved to "Processed_CSV"
